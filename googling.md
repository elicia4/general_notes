# Googling

[***Table of Contents***](/README.md)

You can google a lot more precisely if you know what you're doing. Google
interprets searches based on a very complex set of rules and suggests the best
possible result, but sometimes it just serves up garbage, it makes general
guesses on what you really mean.

1. You can limit search results to particular times. After seaching,
   click on `Tools`, then `Any time` to specify the time range.

1. To make a precise search, use `" "`:
   ```
   "std :: list"
   ```
1. To can exclude words from your search with `-`:
   ```
   "std :: list" -transmitted
   ```
1. To specify multiple terms:
   ```
   "dick ball" "colorado" "senator"
   ```
1. To specify a file type:
   ```
   filetype:pdf "hacking"
   ```
1. To specify a site:
   ```
   site:https://www.zoopraha.cz/ "panda"
   ```
   Or:
   ```
   site:theguardian.com filetype:pdf
   ```
1. Google has a built-in tool for advanced searches:
   ```
   https://www.google.com/advanced_search
   ```

I haven't been able to find any reliable extensive documentation on the topic.
Continuing to explore it further seems unnecessary now, maybe I'll come back to
it later. This is the best thing I've managed to find:
