You can google a lot more precisely if you know what you're doing. Google
interprets searches based on a very complex set of rules and suggests the best
possible result, but sometimes it just serves up garbage, it makes general
guesses on what you really mean.

1. You can limit search results to particular times. After doing a search,
   click on `Tools`, then click on `Any time` to specify the time range.

1. To make a precise search, use `" "`:
   ```
   "std :: list"
   ```
   If you don't it like so, you might get something nasty instead.

1. To can exclude word from your search with `-`:
   ```
   "std :: list" -transmitted
   ```
1. To specify multiple terms:
   ```
   "dick ball" "colorado" "senator"
   ```
1. To specify a file type:
   ```
   filetype:pdf "hacking"
   ```
1. To specify a specific site:
   ```
   site:https://www.zoopraha.cz/ "panda"
   ```
   Or:
   ```
   site:theguardian.com filetype:pdf
   ```
1. Google has a built-in tool for advanced searches:
   ```
   https://www.google.com/advanced_search
   ```
