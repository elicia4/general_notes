- When buying used ThinkPads, ensure that the BIOS is Not Locked with a
  Supervisor Password and CompuTrace (a.k.a. Absolute, LoJack for laptops) is
  Not Activated
- Power supply ie connector isn't loose.
- Battery is a big one for obvious reasons.
- Are all the keys functioning?
- Trackpad and any pointers devices are a pain to fix.
- Dirt and debris in the keyboard and ports can signify anything from keystroke
  issues,.port failures, and cooling of components.
- Physical damage can equate to entryways for things to clog up your machine.
- Is it refurbished with the hard drive replaced? You should check which make
  of drive you get with the laptop it could be a noisy ball bearing 5400rpm
  2.5" salvaged from scrap or a cheap SSD. Check it out and do a scan for bad
  sectors etc.
- The operating system? Is it a legitimate windows key on a fresh install or is
  it a pirated copy? Are there still previous users files on it? That's a huge
  issue.
- Are all the io port's not showing any conflicts or errors? Do the audio
  inputs and outputs function properly?
- Do the speakers and built in microphone work? Do the speakers make any
  crackling sound when volume is turned up?
- Does the screen have any fading, ghosting, contrast issues, flickering,
  colours looking too pink or blue, or black spots?
- Does closing the laptop place it in a sleep mode?
- Has the ram been downgraded to a lower frequency and smaller dim than what
  the model number suggests?
- Is the bios unlocked? Better hope there's no password that wasn't included
  that locks you out. You may be up shit Creek without a paddle if you want to
  change OS.
- How's the temperature? Is the CPU clocked to specifications? Is it the
  correct cpu for that laptop?
- Does the WiFi and ethernet connect properly? Is the mac addresses on their
  been used in naughty ways? Wifi routers, modems, SOCs, and the like all have
  a certain lifespan where connectivity decreases. Is it compatible with your
  home network without an adapter?
- Are there any hardware components that would hinder your plans to use Linux
  or BSD for example? Something may seem like a good deal but you may later
  discover it has proprietary drivers typically software driven that will haunt
  you if you want to use \*Nix.
- Also is it straight up stolen? Are there serial numbers left or removed
  purposefully? Was it too good of a deal you couldn't pass up?
